		<h1 class="uk-heading-small">Advance Wars: Dual Strike</h1>

		<img class="uk-align-right" src="assets/Advance_Wars_DS_cover_art.jpg" alt="">

		<p>is a turn-based tactics video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld game console. It is the third installment in the <span class="uk-text-primary uk-text-italic">Advance Wars</span> series (first on DS media) and was released in Japan on June 23, 2005, in North America on August 22, 2005, in Europe on September 30, 2005, and in Australia on March 22, 2006. The game is preceded by <span class="uk-text-primary uk-text-italic">Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</span> and succeeded by <span class="uk-text-primary uk-text-italic">Advance Wars: Days of Ruin</span>. <span class="uk-text-italic">Advance Wars</span> is the international title of the <span class="uk-text-italic">Wars</span> video game series, which dates back to the Family Computer game <span class="uk-text-italic">Famicom Wars</span> in 1988.</p>

		<p>The storyline is a continuation of the previous series and is set in the new location of Omega Land. Black Hole has returned under the leadership of a new commander who seeks to give himself eternal life by draining the energy of Omega Land. The Allied Nations struggle to overcome this threat and are eventually joined by several former Black Hole commanding officers in an effort to save the land.</p>

		<h1>Gameplay</h1>

		<p>The player's objective in <span class="uk-text-italic">Dual Strike</span> is to defeat the enemy army with their own army. Except in some campaign missions with special objectives, there are two ways to defeat an opponent: destroy all of the enemy's units or capture their headquarters. Gameplay is turn-based. Two to four armies, each headed by one or two commanding officers (COs), take turns building and commanding units on grid-based maps. When one army is finished issuing commands to its units, it ends its turn, and the next army moves. To build units, funds (the game's currency) are used. Funds are acquired at a rate of 1000g per allied property per turn.
		<a name="commands"></a>
		</p>


		<h3>Commands</h3>
		<p>Every turn, units, which consist of ground, sea and air units, can move across the different types of terrain and attack enemy units or perform other actions, such as capturing a base or resupplying friendly units. To command a unit, click on it. A list of commands are as follows:</p>
		<ul uk-accordion="multiple:true">
			<li class="uk-padding uk-padding-remove-vertical">
		        <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Move</a>
		        <div class="uk-accordion-content">
		            <p>Moves a unit. The range of movement and consumption of fuel depends on the unit and the terrain that is being moved over.</p>
		        </div></li>
		    <li class="uk-padding uk-padding-remove-vertical">
		        <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Wait</a>
		        <div class="uk-accordion-content">
		            <p>The unit does nothing, and ends its turn. In the event where unit does not want to be moved, a command is not necessary.</p>
		        </div></li>
		    <li class="uk-padding uk-padding-remove-vertical">
		        <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Fire</a>
		        <div class="uk-accordion-content">
		            <p>If in range to attack the enemy, this command will appear. Red squares will show over enemy units that can be attacked. By moving the cursor over an attackable unit, a percentage will be shown. A rating higher than 100% indicates a one-hit-kill. 55% will inflict either a 5HP or 6HP damage to the enemy unit, 42% will most likely do 4 damage, etc.</p>
		        </div></li>
		    <li class="uk-padding uk-padding-remove-vertical">
		        <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Capture</a>
		        <div class="uk-accordion-content">
		            <p>This command is exclusive to <a href="landUnits.html#infantry" class="uk-text-primary">Infantry</a> and <a href="landUnits.html#mech" class="uk-text-primary">Mechs</a>. This captures buildings that an infantry or mech is standing on top of at a rate of the unit's HP (hit points). All buildings have 20 capture points to start, and capturing a building reduces it's capture points. When it becomes 0, the building is captured.</p>
		        </div></li>
		    <li class="uk-padding uk-padding-remove-vertical">
		        <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Supply</a>
		        <div class="uk-accordion-content">
		            <p>Exclusive to the <a href="landUnits.html#apc" class="uk-text-primary">APC</a> unit, this command replenishes all adjacent units with fuel and ammo.</p>
		        </div></li>
		    <li class="uk-padding uk-padding-remove-vertical">
		        <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Load</a>
		        <div class="uk-accordion-content">

This enables them to move much farther than normal, although they cannot attack. However, damage suffered by the transport unit does not affect the unit inside. The contained unit can be then unloaded to any applicable adjacent space by reselecting the transport unit. <a href="" class="uk-text-primary">Landers</a> specifically can load 2 of any land unit.</p>
		        </div></li>
		    <li class="uk-padding uk-padding-remove-vertical">
		        <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Join</a>
		        <div class="uk-accordion-content">
		            <p>If two of the same type of unit have lower than 10HP (or if one is lower), they may be <strong>combined</strong> by moving one on top of the other. A unit cannot exceed 10HP. Any excess HP is converted to funds at a rate of 10% per HP. So an 8HP and a 7HP infantry are combined. They add to 15HP, but since the max is 10, the extra 5 is converted into funds. 5HP x 10% of the units cost = 50% of the cost of an infantry will be added to the stash.</p>
		        </div></li>

		<h3>Units</h3>

		<p>There are 25 different types of military units in Advance Wars. Each unit has a set amount of attack power, vision range in Fog of War, movement range and type, and fuel supply. Some units have two weapons which can be used against different types of enemy units. There are both direct and indirect attack units, as well as transport units. All the units are either infantry, vehicles, ships or air units. Units have specific strengths and weaknesses corresponding to other units.</p>

		<p>One rule of thumb all units adhere to is their fuel supply; ground units who run out cannot move, while air and naval units who run out are destroyed, consuming fuel even when stationary. Units that can shift into stealth mode (namely submarines and stealth planes) consume more fuel than usual when stealthed.
		<a name="combat"></a>
		</p>

		<h3>Combat</h3>
		<p> All units are limited in the types of units they can attack. What dictates a unit's ability to attack different targets are its primary and secondary weapons. For example, the <a href="" class="uk-text-primary">Mech</a> unit has a bazooka that can only be fired at land vehicles, but are more powerful for that purpose than their secondary weapons, machine guns, which Mechs will use against other Mechs, Infantry, and helicopters. Attacking consumes ammo; if ammo runs out, an unit cannot fire unless it has a secondary weapon (which usually has unlimited ammo) and is applicable to the current target. Against infantry units, secondary weapons will be used on default.</p>

		<p>When entering an combat sequence, the initiating unit will attack first, and the target unit will receive damage. If the target unit is capapble, it will then counterattack. The counterattack is limited by the damage received in the initial attack. Units that can attack do so either directly or indirectly. Direct attacks are made on adjacent enemy units, and can be done before or after moving, but the attacking unit will be susceptible to damage from a follow-up counterattack. Indirect attacks are made on units within a given range, and do not receive counterattacks. However, in order for an indirect attack to be made the attacking unit must not have moved on its turn.</p> 

		<p>The amount of damage done by a unit to an enemy unit in combat, comes down to a number of factors: the number of hit points the attacker has, whether they can use their main weapon (if not, they either cannot, or will use their secondary weapon instead), the type of unit the attacker and the defender are, and the terrain the enemy unit is on; by contrast, if the enemy unit is directly attacked, the same factors determine the damage done when they counter-attack the attacking unit. The majority of units have main weapons with a limited supply of ammunition, with the amount of ammo depending on the type of unit. Units with secondary weapons will resort to these when their primary weapon's ammunition runs out until they are resupplied.

		</p>

		<h3>COs and CO Powers</h3>
		<p>Each CO has its own abilities, some passive and some active (passive abilities are called Day-to-Day Effects). After taking enough damage (or dealing enough out), a CO's "power bar" will fill, enabling them to unleash a devastating attack. The bar fills like so: All damage taken is added to the power bar, and half of the damage dealt is added to it. So if a 10HP Infantry is destroyed, 500G is added to the CO power bar, and 1000G is added if one's own is destroyed. This is true for any whole number hp fraction of damage done to a unit, that is, if a 10hp infantry is reduced to 4 hp, the attacker gains 300G to the CO power bar, and the defender gains 600G to the bar.</p>

		<p>Filling up a bar partially will allow some COs to use their CO power (often indicated by the smaller stars), whereas filling the power bar up all the way will allow COs to use their Super CO Power, which is in most cases a stronger version of the original CO Power.</p>

		<p class="uk-text-center"><span uk-icon="icon: star; ratio:0.8"></span><span uk-icon="icon: star; ratio:0.8"></span><span uk-icon="icon: star; ratio:0.8"></span><span uk-icon="icon: star; ratio: 1.2"></span><span uk-icon="icon: star; ratio: 1.2"></span><span uk-icon="icon: star; ratio: 1.2"></span></p>

		<p>The namesake of Dual Strike is the ability to use two COs in a battle to command a single army. By using two COs, the weaknesses of each CO can effectively be covered, as the player has the ability to swap COs back and forth at the end of each turn. In addition, when using two COs, a new CO power named "Tag Power," or "Dual Strike," can be used. It allows players to use both COs' Super CO powers consecutively in the same turn, and effectively allows the player to have two turns.
		<a name="dual"></a>
		</p>

		<h3>Dual Front</h3>
		<p>The DS's two screens provide new ways of presenting a round of battle in Dual Strike. The bottom screen is where the main battle takes place, while the top screen is used to display the terrain and unit intelligence. However, in some missions, the top screen shows a second front. The second front is a second battle that is waged simultaneously with the battle on the lower screen, which is integral to some missions. The player can change the top screen back to the intel screen and vice versa. Units in the first front can be sent to the second. Units sent to the second front, however, cannot be sent back to the first front.</p>

		<p>When battling on two fronts, one CO on each team takes control of one front. The CO on the second front can either be controlled by a computer or by the player. If the battle on the second front ends before the battle on the first front, the winning CO will join their teammate on the first front or other advantages will be given to the victor. Any remaining units on the second front are then added to the victor's CO power meter.</p>
