	<h1>Layout Framework Project Proposal - Jefferson Duan</h1>
	<h2>Framework: UIKit</h2>
	<p>I am choosing UIKit because as far as I've looked, UIKit seems to be the only framework that has easily accessible animation features (I may be mistaken on this front, and if so please let me know). The kind of site I want to create is one that has a lot of content but not a lot of surface area, and so information will be moving on and off the main page, like placing and removing things off a desktop or table surface (if that makes sense). I plan to use things that can show and hide content, like accordions, switchers, etc, all hopefully with some animation to them.

	<h2>Proposal: A Better Strategy Wiki</h2>
	<img src="assets/Advance_Wars_logo.png">
	<p>Advance Wars is an modern army themed turn-based tactics video game that originated on the Gameboy Advance, releasing four games and well into the Nintendo DS era. At its core the game is a surprisingly deep strategy game, complete with unique playable commanding officers, a myriad of unit types, rather complex map and terrain mechanics, all centered around a simple and intuitive combat system. As much as I'd like to tackle the whole series, the site I want to create will probably focus on one of the two latest game in the series, <i>Dual Strike</i> or <i>Days of Ruin</i>. The site will act as a sort of an accessible strategy guide, providing detailed information on both general mechancis and specific CO (short for commanding officer) dynamics, even delving into the game calculations at some points. All the information used will most likely be sourced from fan-wikis.</p>
	<p>I'm making a better wiki basically. One with extra bells and whistles because I care about this niche game too much.</p>
